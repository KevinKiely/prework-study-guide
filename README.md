# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description


I began this project as a way to manage information and take notes about HTML, CSS, and Javascript as I begin my journey as a software developer. This project will help keep information organized so it can be looked upon later as a resource. The motivation is that I recently changed careers and want to get into this new career as quickly as possible, which will only happen if I stay organized and continuously progress my skills.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
